# Simple FOMO - Round 2
This is a simple ethereum lottery game that now rewards the last person to enter the lottery AND the person with the most entries with the entire pot split evenly. This will encourage potential entrants to enter early to benefit from lower costs. While the premise is basic, it is an exploration into the psychology of human desire to uncover the visceral feelings that describe our fears of missing out (FOMO).
